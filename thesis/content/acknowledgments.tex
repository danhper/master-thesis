  I would first like to thank my supervisor, Professor Shigeru Chiba, for all
  the guidance he provided me with during the course of my master's degree. He
  has always been very available and helped me through many instructive
  discussions, not only to improve and consolidate my research, but also to
  gain more insight about research and life in general.

  I also want to thank all my colleagues of the Core Software Group for all the
  insightful conversations and of course for the nice two years we spent
  (and coffee we had) together.

  I would also like to thank AtCoder Inc. for taking the time to reply to my
  request and allowing me to use their data for my research and experiments.

  Finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my partner, Ai
  Miyuki, and to my parents who have always supported me and without whom I
  would not have been able to complete this degree.
