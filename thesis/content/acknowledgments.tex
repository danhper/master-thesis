  I would first like to thank my supervisor, Professor Shigeru Chiba, for all
  the guidance he provided me with during the course of my master's degree. He
  has always been very available and helped me through many instructive
  discussions, not only to improve and consolidate my research, but also to
  gain more insight about research and life in general.

  I also want to thank all my colleagues of the Core Software Group for all the
  insightful conversations and of course for the nice two years we spent
  (and coffee we had) together.

  Finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my parents who have
  supported me during all the course of my studies and without whom I would not
  have had the opportunity to follow this degree.
